                                I am a self-taught developer and I started my
                                journey past 1 year. At the moment I am
                                tailoring my skills on HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                                Bootstrap and React. This gives me a lot of joy
                                when I see my progress, while I am learning and
                                trying to take action on what I have learned.
